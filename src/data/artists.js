    bio: `I’m into a lot of things. There are so many cool ideas and things out there. Like oranges – they’re so perfect and naturally round and saturated!!!
    
I’m not into things like school – it’s too much of a structured environment to allow for certain individuals to exercise their creative sides. That’s part of the reason why I created Mansion, to give a space for creatives to learn about stuff and collaborate with each other.
I love to see people dance to music. I love even more to see people dance to my own music. I love EVEN MORE to see people dance to Shooting Stars by Bag Raiders.
Let’s all inspire each other and make some really cool stuff!`
